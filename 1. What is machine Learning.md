## What is Machine Learning?
There are various definations of machine learning found in web. Some notable definations are listed belows:
1. The oldest and informal defination of machine learning was given by Arthur Samuel which describes as:
    * Def 1: "Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".

2. The most modern defination was given by Tom Mitchell and he states it as:
    * Def 2: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

What does Mitchell's defination actually means can be more elaborated by following examples:
  Let us say a machine is playing checker game the T, P, and E can be well defined by
   * E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

   * T = the task of playing checkers.

   * P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

## Machine Learning: Why Should I care about it?
Due to growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage, machine learning is changing domains of technology like never changed before. It has now become vital tools for many business interprises or in education research for finding new patterns or new predictions. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:

   * The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car? The essence of machine learning.

   * Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life.

   * Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with linguistic rule creation.

   * Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today.   

## Machine learning methods     
In general, Any Machine Learning problem can be categories in two group.
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervisd Learning.

There also some other category of ML methods like:
1. Reinforcement Learning
2. Semi-Supervised Learning
3. Active Learning
4. Genetic algorithms

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. We can categories supervised learning methods  in a few large categories:      

  1. Classification:
       * In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. Example: Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.  
  2. Regression:
       * In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. Example: Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables. We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data. With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.  

The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called **clustering**, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as **density estimation**, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of **visualization**

* Examples:
   * Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

   * Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).
